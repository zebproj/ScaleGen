TODO list for scalegen functions:

Instead of using an int to store scale values, use a struct.

That way we can have an int value that stores the number of scales...
no hard limit on the number of notes in the scale/cluster.

Functions that return 3 char string of midi val:

midi_to_sharp: will convert 61 to C#4
midi_to_flat: will convert 61 to Db4

or maybe one midi_to_string function with an argument to indicate sharp or flat?

both functions will convert natural notes with -, eg 60 = C-4
